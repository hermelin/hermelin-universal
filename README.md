# Hermelin
Hermelin is a fork of [Hotot](https://github.com/lyricat/Hotot), the "Lightweight, Flexible Microblogging Client" supporting Twitter at this point of development. (identi.ca and similar may be readded later)

I forked Hotot for the reason that it won't get any bigger updates here in the future because the developer stated that the [future updates of hotot won't be opensource & free](https://d34d.de/?p=160).

I think it is sad that there aren't much [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) Twitter Clients, so i don't want Hotot to die.

##Installing the Chrome/Chromium Version:


To install Hermelin in chrome or chromium, simply install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hermelin-twitter-client/jkajhbbfjgkbjeldopihmjfcaebjgobg). 

To load the newest commit you have to:

* Download this git repo (via the git clone command on linux or the downloadable zip file).
* Go to Chrome/Chromiums Extensions page and activate developer mode (top right corner).
* Click "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" and choose the data/ directory from the repo.

It is not possible to update the Web Store Extension with this method.

For that you'd have to:

* Download this git repo (via the git clone command on linux or the downloadable zip file).
* Copy everything ***except manifest.json*** from the data/ directory into the Web Store extensions directory.

The folder where Chrome/Chromium extensions are stored differs from OS to OS - In there should be the folder jkajhbbfjgkbjeldopihmjfcaebjgobg/ in which you'll find the folder with the newest version.

The files from the data/ directory go in this folder.

## Building from source:
Since Hermelins core is largely based on HTML5, JavaScript and Webkit technology, it can be run under many Webkit implementations. Hermelin officially supports Gtk, Qt, and Chrome webkit wrapper.

###Dependencies:

Common Requirements:
* cmake
* intltool

Qt Wrapper:
* Qt4 (newer than 4.7)
* KDE Libs (optional, for better KDE integration)

Gtk2 Wrapper:
* python2
* pygtk
* python-webkit
* python-keybinder (optional)

Gtk3 Wrapper:
* python-gobject (for gtk3 wrapper)
* gtk3
* libwebkit3

On Ubuntu 11.10 all of these resources are available in the standard repositories:
    # apt-get install libqt4-dev cmake intltool

###Build:
If you don't care about the following and just want to install or update the gtk
wrappers, you can use(or modify) [this](https://gist.github.com/fliiiix/8146460) buildscript.
It has to be executable and in the Hermelin directory which you get via:

    $ git clone https://github.com/remhume/Hermelin.git



The standard process for building from source is:

    $ cd {source-directory}
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

Install as root:

    # make install

This will install Hermelin in the default prefix: `/usr/local`, in order to change
to a different prefix, use:
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/prefix/you/want`

By default gtk with gir, and qt will be built.

The following options can be applied, with On/Off as value.

* `-DWITH_GTK2` build gtk2 version (program name: `hermelin-gtk2`)
* `-DWITH_GTK3` build gtk3 version (program name: `hermelin-gtk3`)
* `-DWITH_GTK` build gtk version (without `-DWITH_GTK{2,3}` options, the program's name will be `hermelin`)
* `-DWITH_GIR` build gir(gtk3) version (need gtk enabled) (without `-DWITH_GTK{2,3}` options, this option will disable gtk2 version.)
* `-DWITH_QT` build qt version (program name: `hermelin-qt`)
* `-DWITH_KDE` build qt with kde support (program name by default: `hermelin-qt`)
* `-DWITH_KDE_QT` build qt with (program name: `hermelin-kde`) and without (program name: `hermelin-qt`) kde support at the same time.
* `-DWITH_CHROME` build chrome with mk-chrome-app.sh, will be placed under build directory/chrome/hermelin-chrome.zip, need rsync

There is also a option to specify the name of the qt binary with kde support enabled.

* `-DHERMELIN_KDE_BIN_NAME=` the value of this option is ONLY used when `-DWITH_QT=On` `-DWITH_KDE=On` `-DWITH_KDE_QT=Off` (all default), in which case this will be the name of the qt wrapper.

For example, to just build gtk with gir rather than qt, the `cmake` command
will be:

    $ cmake .. -DWITH_QT=off

To build all local wrappers (useful for split package,):

    $ cmake .. -DWITH_GTK2=On -DWITH_GTK3=On -DWITH_KDE_QT=On

To build on Archlinux, add:
`-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2`

There is something about a Gtk version in Python using some sort of
"distutils".
